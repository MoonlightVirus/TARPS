# TARPS
Tensorflow Action Recognition Program as a main component for sign language translator speaker


In order for this to function correctly make sure to install jupyter notebook and python 3.10

Here are the things you have to follow:
1. Install Python 3.10
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/ (Scroll down till the end and download the windows installer (64-bit)

2. Download the dataset used for the program in this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ufZcREUM4EXw_07YF45W17HXNKZMwhLg?usp=sharing

3. Install Jupyter Notebook
https://jupyter.org/install (install this once you have Python 3.10 in your device)
-open command prompt by using the search bar or using windows key + r then type cmd
-type pip install jupyter notebook
-wait until it downloaded
-then type either jupyter notebook or python -m notebook to start the localhost
-find "Tensorflow_ThirdUpdate" in the file browser of localhost:8888/tree

4. Setup the Program (do it with or without me)
-Click a block of code. (The link shows what it looks like)

-press Shift + Enter to activate it. (ALways wait for one block of code to finish loading first before moving on) (the loading will be seen like [*] and it finishes when [ ] displays a number on the left side of the code block)

-keep activating the codes until you get to ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/b3ab85ef-e1c9-43e0-9207-a2f68baa9bd2) The Video capture codes.

-when you activate that you need to display your left hand on screen and press "q" to exit the console.

-then continue doing Shift + Enter again until you get to here ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/6bd4bbba-43a7-40db-9af8-0c6f0b88047c) which you need to skip it because it's the code to capture movement data for the AI.

-Continue activating blocks of code until you get to this part ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/c3a149bd-bc5d-4114-819d-b180c6a6759b)

-Once you arrive here ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/03522e1d-a68c-4d53-9788-b7d834c525cc) Change the Epoch to either 100 or 80 epochs.

-That line of code is used to train the AI, I suggest to keep doing it until the Accuracy reaches until 90+ and immediately stop to avoid overfitting (or stagnation). ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/fcd81242-2f64-4187-a83e-279f6c989bb6) Click the Square button ONLY when you want to forcefully stop the line of code.

-Once you did that and gotten 90+ accuracy score. Continue activating again then skip this ![image](https://github.com/MoonlightVirus/TARPS/assets/101128234/280ce0a3-fa82-4ddc-b610-f6ae1f78d0bc)

5. Enjoy and Try using the Program in real time! (press "q" to end the console anytime)
